## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the 65nm CMOS Low-Voltage Bandgap Reference (BGR) project. This project focuses on designing a low-voltage BGR circuit utilizing the OTA Miller methodology.
In this repository, I will demonstate clearer about implementing Miller methodology in BGR design, in order to achieve low voltage with also small slew-rate.

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to design and simulate a low-voltage bandgap reference (BGR) in a 65nm CMOS process. The design aims to achieve high performance in terms of power efficiency and thermal stability.
More specific:
- The bandgap reference (BGR) block is a fundamental component in many analog and digital circuit designs. Its primary function is to generate a stable direct current or constant voltage that is minimally affected by noise, supply voltage variations, and temperature changes, ensuring consistent performance under varying operating conditions. This stable reference voltage is crucial in applications like analog-to-digital conversion, where it serves as a benchmark for comparing input voltages to determine their corresponding digital values. The focus of this thesis is to theoretically understand the performance limitations and to design a robust BGR circuit.
- A widely used topology for CMOS Bandgap Voltage References (BGR) includes an operational amplifier (op-amp), a current source, three resistors, and two parasitic bipolar transistors. This configuration is appreciated for its simplicity and strong performance, and it can be easily modified for high accuracy.
- In this study, the focus is on using the OTA Miller topology and methodology to optimize the BGR circuit. The design leverages a gm/ID approach, utilizing early voltage (VA) to enhance energy efficiency. The goal is to create a BGR block with a low-power circuit topology using 65nm CMOS technology from TSMC, which is expected to operate stably at a 1.8V power supply and achieve a 54dB source noise cancellation coefficient. The circuit is designed to function within a temperature range of -40 to 135 degrees Celsius, delivering an output voltage of 1.2V with a temperature dependence coefficient of just 6ppm/℃. This design is compared to previous works to highlight improvements in performance and optimization.
